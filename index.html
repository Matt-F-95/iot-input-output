                                        <h5>Concept of Project</h5>
                                        <li>The overall concept of this project was to create a multifunctional tool that would allow a user to view either the temperature or compass
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                            This project works by use of separate functions that run whenever the A or B button is clicked on the micro bit board.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                        <h5>Concept of Project</h5>
                                        <li>The overall concept of this project was to create a multifunctional tool that would allow a user to view either the temperature or compass
                                            </li>

                                            This project works by use of separate functions that run whenever the A or B button is clicked on the micro bit board.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                        <h5>On-start & Forever Functions</h5>
                                        <li>On start-up, the board it plays a small little melody and shows a ‘Welcome’ message
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Afterwards, a function runs that tells the user to hit the A button to view temperature and shows and arrow to the button, then shows an arrow to the B button along with a message telling users to hit this button to view compass location.
                                        </li>

                                        <h5>A button allows the users to see the temperature when it is pressed</h5>
                                        <li>As well, there is an if else statement that runs if the temp is below 21°C it sends a sad face along with a tiny melody that is played. In addition, when the temperature is at or above 21°C it sends out a happy face and a ‘ode to joy’ melody is played.
                                        </li>

                                        <h5>B Button allows the users to see your compass location when it is pressed.</h5>
                                        <li>So, after the user presses the B button a melody plays letting the user know that the button has indeed been pressed and the function will run to show the compass location. This compass function uses looping structure to show the message run twice after being clicked by the user.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>What you learned about the inputs and outputs chosen</div>
                                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <h5>Inputs</h5>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            I learned how simple it is to use input such as, temperature or a compass while coding using the micro bit. First off, I loved how simple and easy it was to simply just go into the input tab located within the MakeCode program and select ‘temperature’ or ‘compass heading’ and begin coding various features with the micro bit. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <h5>Outputs</h5>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            What I learned about my outputs was that you can still be very creative with your chosen music/melody and LED Grid image. Any designer or complete novice could create a song or image that can be used within the MakeCode program and see that actual creation come to life using the micro bit board.

                                        </li>
                                        
                                    </ul>
                                </span></div>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">whatshot</i>What you learned about the programming interface</div>
                                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            I learned that the MakeCode Microsoft interface is very simple and easy to use for beginners to experienced programmers. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            I found that the block layout system was very easy to comprehend how to actually make a functioning micro bit project. I personally enjoyed the visual representation of the micro bit running, along with the block component feature to create functions and add logic to your code. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Moreover, I found that this programming interface would be a perfect way to teach people programming due to the simplicity of the block elements to code the micro bit from scratch.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Finally, I found that the interface helped me begin to visual the code more simply than I would normally, since the block component style of coding makes understanding various different structures to loops, logic statements, or onclick functions simple and easily digestible for seeing how the code is programmed.
                                        </li>
